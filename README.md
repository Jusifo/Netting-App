# Netting-App

This small Java program demonstrates a basic implementation of a netting algorithm. Netting is a financial process used to offset and consolidate multiple transactions between parties into a single net payment or receipt, minimizing the number of transactions and reducing risks and costs.
I took some time as a hobby project to develop this algorithm to understand and implement the netting concept. The code provides a straightforward example of how netting can be applied to balance transactions. Feel free to explore and adapt the algorithm for your own financial or computational needs.

A command-line tool that calculates the simplest way to settle debts among a group of people. This project demonstrates a netting algorithm in Java, built with Gradle.
